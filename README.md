# Stock-Market-Model
Created a machine learning model in Python that uses a dataset from Quandl, specifically Google Stock prices, to predict the closing price at the end of the day.

Currently a WIP.

Adjust the "predicted days" variable to change how much into the future you want, must also uncomment the pip install at the beginning of the Python file in order to install quandl, unless you already have it
